# Infineon XMC4200 Digital Power Control Card

Infineon XMC4200 Digital Power Control Card is equipped with the ARM Cortex-M4 based  [XMC4200 microcontroller (MCU)](https://www.infineon.com/dgdl/xmc4100_xmc4200_rm_v1.5_2014_04.pdf?fileId=db3a30433afc7e3e013b3c44ccd35c20&ack=t)  from Infineon Technologies.

Official reference for Infineon XMC4200 Digital Power Control Card can be found  [here](https://www.infineon.com/dgdl/Infineon-XMC4200_Microcontroller_Digital_Power_Control_Card_User_Manual-UM-v01_01-EN.pdf?fileId=5546d4625185e0e201518bf18e663e3b).

This board is designed to be used with the [XMC Digital Power Explorer Kit](https://www.infineon.com/cms/en/product/evaluation-boards/kit_xmc_dp_exp_01/). The kitâ€™s power board features synchronous buck converter with on-board resistive load banks. The load banks can be switched between 10%, 55% and 100% of the maximum load, so that the transient response and the quality of the control loop under different load conditions can be tested (for example continuous conduction mode vs. discontinuous conduction mode).
