# Gate
Using the ZDM you’re able to send out your device’s data through gates.
You can activate a webhook to receive all the data sent on a specific tag in a workspace or
you can create a export gate to receive your data periodically.
ZDM allows you also to visualize data on Ubidots through a Webhook.
