# BMP180 Module

This module contains the driver for BOSCH BMP180 Digital Barometric Pressure Sensor. The ultra-low power, low voltage electronics of the BMP180 is optimized for use in mobile devices and the I2C interface allows for easy system integration with a microcontroller. The BMP180 is based on piezo-resistive technology for EMC robustness, high accuracy and linearity as well as long term stability ([datasheet](https://ae-bst.resource.bosch.com/media/_tech/media/datasheets/BST-BMP180-DS000-121.pdf)).


**`class BMP180(i2cdrv,addr=0x77,clk=100000)`**

Creates an instance of a new BMP180.


**Arguments:**
    

 - **i2cdrv** – I2C Bus used ‘( I2C0, … )’
 - **addr** – Slave address, default 0x77
 - **clk** – Clock speed, default 100kHz

Example:

```
from bosch.bmp180 import bmp180

...

bmp = bmp180.BMP180(I2C0)
bmp.start()
bmp.init()
temp, pres = bmp.get_temp_pres()
```


**`init(oss=0)`**

Initialize the BMP180 calibrating the sensor and setting the oss value.


**Arguments:**

 - **oss** – OverSampling Setting value (from 0 to 4), default 0

**`set_over_sampling_setting(oss)`**

Sets the OverSampling Setting value of the BMP180.


**Arguments:**

 - **oss** – OverSampling Setting value (from 0 to 4 allowed)

```NOTE```: The OverSampling Setting parameter selects different operating modes according to give the possibility for findind the optimum compromise between power consumption, speed, and resolution; in the table below allowed values are reported with related operating modes.

**`get_raw_temp()`**

Retrieves the current temperature data from the sensor as raw value.

Returns raw_t.


**`get_raw_pres()`**

Retrieves the current pressure data from the sensor as raw value; according to the OverSampling Setting value this measure can be faster but less accurate or more precise but slower. (see `set_over_sampling_setting()`)

Returns raw_p.

**`get_temp()`**

Retrieves the current temperature data from the sensor as calibrate value in °C.

Returns temp.


**`get_pres()`**

Retrieves the current pressure data from the sensor as calibrate value in Pa; according to the OverSampling Setting value this measure can be faster but less accurate or more precise but slower. (see `set_over_sampling_setting()`)

Returns pres.


**`get_temp_pres()`**

Retrieves the current temperature (in °C) and pressure (in Pa) data from the sensor as calibrate values in one call.

Returns temp.

**`get_altitude()`**

Calculates, from measured pressure, the current altitude data as value in meters.

Returns altitude.

**`get_sea_level_pres()`**

Calculates, from measured pressure, the pressure (in Pa) at sea level when given a known altitude in meters.

Returns p0 (pressure at sea level).
