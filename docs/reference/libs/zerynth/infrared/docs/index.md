# Zerynth Infra Red

Infra Red Technology is used for short and medium range communications and controls.

Some systems operate in line-of-sight mode (there must be a visually unobstructed straight line through space between transmitter and receiver), and other systems operate in diffuse mode, also called scatter mode (the source and destination are not directly visible to each other but they can exchange data thanks to the signal rebounds).

!!! note
	IR wireless signals cannot passthrough walls.

IR wireless technology is used in intrusion detectors, home-entertainment control units, robot control systems, line-of-sight laser communications, cordless microphones, headsets, modems, printers and other peripherals.

Here below, the Zerynth Library for Infra Red functionalities and some examples to better understand how to use it.
