# Zerynth Shield

The Zerynth Shield is a ready to use multi-sensors device that adds smart functions to your everyday life objects.

The first shield that can be plugged on both Arduino and Particle devices without any adapter.

With a set of on-board sensors and all the most used communication ports ready to be plugged, the Zerynth Shield allows makers, designers and IoT professionals to easily develop their smart objects, without care about wiring and soldering becoming crazy with funky circuits.

Here below, the Zerynth Library for handling the Zerynth Shieldâ€™s sensors and some examples to better understand how to use it.
