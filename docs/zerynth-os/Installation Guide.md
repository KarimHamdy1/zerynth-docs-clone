If you choose the Offline Installation you need to have downloaded also the offline package repository in advance related to your platform (Windows, Mac, Linux), from the [Zerynth Download page](https://www.zerynth.com/zsdk/).

### Normal Installation and Expert mode

To reduce the amount of files downloaded during the installation process, the installer will let you choose which of the supported architectures to install.

By clicking “Install” none of the available architectures will be downloaded and you will be prompted to download the needed dependencies whenever Zerynth Studio recognize a new board.

By choosing the “Expert Mode” you will be able to select the architectures you wish to download right now, but you will still be prompted to install the needed dependencies if you connect a board with an architecture not included in the already downloaded ones.
